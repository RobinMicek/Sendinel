<!-- About the Project -->
## ⭐ About the Project
Sendinel is a lightweight service for sending transactional emails with ease. Instead of wrestling with multiple email providers, SDKs, and configuration headaches, Sendinel simplifies email delivery to just a single POST request, and your message is on its way.

With built-in support for popular email providers, Sendinel acts as your universal email gateway. You can define reusable templates, manage multiple sender identities, monitor statistics, and keep your email delivery consistent across projects.
